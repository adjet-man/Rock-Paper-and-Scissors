# Introduction 
This is a simple C++ program that simulates the game of rock-paper-scissors between a user and a computer. Here's a brief overview of what the code does:
- The program starts by including necessary header files and declaring variables to keep track of user and computer scores, as well as their choices. 
- The main game loop runs indefinitely until the user chooses to quit. Within each iteration of the loop: 
        ◦ The current scores are printed out. 
        ◦ The user is prompted to choose rock, paper, or scissors, with error handling for invalid input. 
        ◦ The computer generates a random choice. 
        ◦ The winner is determined based on the rules of rock-paper-scissors, and the scores are adjusted accordingly. 
        ◦ The user is asked if they want to play again. If not, the loop breaks and the program exits. 
# Conclusion 
Overall, this program demonstrates basic concepts such as variable declaration, loops, conditional statements, input/output handling, and random number generation in C++.
